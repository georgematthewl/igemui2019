                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>Managing the realization of the usage of synthetic diphtheria exotoxin (i.e. DiphTox/DT) and chimeric
                    HB-EGF/Tar (i.e. HT) receptor, our team proposed a focus on characterizing the part of each
                    BioBrick’s function. This year, our team, would be more focusing on testing the binding ability of
                    both BioBricks in living E. coli spheroplast. FRET system would proceed in the later project of
                    Finding Diphthy next in iGEM 2019. Before heading on to the lab results, it is recommended to fully
                    understand the structure of DT and HT gBlocks and their respective protein functions in Parts
                    (http://2018.igem.org/Team:UI_Indonesia/Parts) and Model domain
                    (http://2018.igem.org/Team:UI_Indonesia/Model) of UI_Indonesia Wiki page.</p>

                <h5>Methods</h5>
                <p>Our lab team started to use traditional cloning for insertion of desired gene into backbone plasmids
                    for expression and iGEM 2018 submission. The traditional cloning would involve the methods of
                    inserting gene fragments into MCS (multiple site cloning) of backbone or between prefix-suffix. The
                    whole processes of gene cloning for further assays in this project are described in the Figure 1 and
                    2.</p>
                <div class="accordion">
                    <h3>Part I: DT and HT Cloning</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Upon receiving our parts (in gBlocks) from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT), we
                            performed PCR to amplify the gBlocks. PCR cloning for all gBlocks used the hand-made
                            designed forward (Fwd) and reverse (Rev) cloning primers (i.e. specifications could be seen
                            in Parts page). Furthermore, cycling formula for PCR cloning and confirmation could be
                            accessed in the lab notes, as we applied GoTaqTM Long PCR enzyme as the Hi-Fi polymerase.
                            The amplified gBlocks were then used as inserts to plasmid vectors. For HT BioBrick, IDT was
                            unable to yield the full sequence in high purity, so we had to split HT into two fragments
                            (HT-1 and HT-2), which would later be amplified, restricted with SalI, and ligated to obtain
                            complete HT fragment.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand, we also prepared vectors for carrying our parts. Backbone pSB1C3-mRFP
                            BBa_J04450) has been used widely in our process of traditional cloning, for it provides
                            much sensitive selection upon transformed recombinant plasmids. Since this plasmid does not
                            contain any available expression promoter for the designed BioBrick, our supervisor
                            suggested the usage of pQE80L expression vector belonged to IHVCB lab for functional assays
                            and analyses. Therefore, we used pSB1C3 as cloning vector for submission to iGEM
                            Headquarters and pQE80L as cloning vector for expression
                            We conducted traditional cloning (restriction-ligation) method to introduce our previously
                            amplified inserts into prepared vectors. Restriction digestion was done sequentially with
                            EcoRI and PstI in total of 8 hours by using the same buffer (i.e. EcoRI buffer and bovine
                            serum antigen (BSA) 1X) with a minimum DNA template of 10 µg. Desalting and low-melting
                            agarose (LMA) 1% electrophoresis purification was done to further remove any possible
                            contaminating enzymes and undesired polynucleotides. Ligation of both vectors and inserts
                            were conducted by adding T4 ligase and its respective buffers to be later incubated 160C
                            overnight</p>

                        <p>Transformation of resultant recombinant plasmids was done in wild-type E. coli K-12 (for
                            submission purpose) and BL21(DE3) (for characterization and validation purpose) via
                            “transformation protocol” methods in the other page. To enhance selection of recombinant E.
                            coli, the transformed products were spread into selective LB agar containing appropriate
                            antibiotic. Antibiotic formulation was complied to the lab’s proven antibiotics sensitivity
                            test. We solubilized the powdered chloramphenicol in ethanol 95% and ampicillin in distilled
                            water until final concentration of 25 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml, respectively. They were then
                            added into LB media with ratio of 1:1000. After spread into LB agar, the transformed
                            products were then incubated at 370C overnight.</p>

                        <p>In the case of transformation with pSB1C3, to select the colony with desired inserts, we
                            performed red-white screening. If the grown colonies were red, it indicated that the
                            colonies were transformed by native pSB1C3-mRFP and we excluded the colonies. We only picked
                            white colonies (indicated that mRFP had been successfully removed from pSB1C3 and possibly
                            replaced by insert) to be further confirmed for desired insert presence by colony PCR. We
                            used VF2 and VR primers (i.e. iGEM standard primers) for confirmation of inserts in pSB1C3,
                            while we used our hand-made designed primers for confirmation of inserts in pQE80L.
                            Finally, we performed mini-prep plasmid isolation for any confirmed colonies with desired
                            inserts in pSB1C3. We grew the colonies in LB liquid medium at 370C shaken overnight.
                            Sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence of inserts before submitted to iGEM
                            Headquarters.</p>
